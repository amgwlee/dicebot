Hello there!
This is just a dumb inside joke Telegram chatbot I work on when I'm bored for inside jokes and memes with friends.
It also simulates dice rolls for the sake of using it sometimes during Dungeons & Dragons, or wherever else you would need to roll dice of various sizes.
If you want to fork it or play around (or you're future me that needs a refresher), just follow these instructions:
1. Check out this page for more in-depth documentation, dicebot uses it as a dependency: https://github.com/mullwar/telebot
2. Make sure node.js is installed
3. Build and install with npm install.
4. To run, go to project root and run npm start.
